# EVTrendsWashington
ML on an EV dataset from the Washington state department to derive insights using Clustering analysis and regression.
Through our Clustering analysis, we came out with 4 EV owner profiles.
Through our regression analysis, we are able to conclude that the Model Year, Electric Range, and Start Odometer Reading heavily influence the sale price of an EV.
